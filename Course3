  1] Name:- Rutuja Bhore
  2] Dynamic Programming
  3] Dynamic programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler 
subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.
using GitHub to manage DP projects can greatly enhance collaboration, version control, and code quality. 
By setting up a well-structured repository, documenting your code, writing tests, and leveraging CI tools, 
you can efficiently develop and maintain dynamic programming solutions.
